 Chapter 18
 ------------------
 HTML & CSS book 
 by Jon Ducket. 
 
 
 **Initial Response**
 I found this to be very interesting, it gave really good insight and perspective of a person / people of different origin, nationality, race and financial status on what is first seen on a website, What is the best way to group information, what pictures do or dont do to a site. It gave examples of ways to think of the consumer, rather than as the developer. In the long run, if you are creating a web page for a monetary gain, it doesn't matter what you think of it. Matters absolutely none. You are making this site for consumers and it is all up to them. 
 
    Reading further into the book, and skimming chapter one, I see how this book will transform a basic new software developer into a broad spectrum all around, main stream, developer that will move him/her self forward in life. Learning how different groupings, fonts, sizes, colors etc will change the consumers eye for the site.
