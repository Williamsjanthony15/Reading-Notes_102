CSS Notes

CSS Box model 
    - outline and boarder means the same thing.... Inside of that is Padding
Doing the following will apply it to all of the element prior to the { }
   * {
       outline: (x)px black solid
   }
p {
        padding: (X)px;

    }   Padding = the information inside of the box

    h2 { 
        margin: (x)px;
    }   Margin = the whole box is relevant to the other boxes around it

        CSS LINK TAG WILL ALWAYS BE INSIDE OF THE HEAD
