Need to read 
    reading - notes entry 
    do along


    <!-- moving code to comment status would be to highlight, command /. done -->

    <!-- adding java script  -->

    Create a new file under the html file naming it (XXX.js)
    than <script> src=(file name) </script> in the head under the css tag


    under JS file youll type console.log("xxxx") THat will be in dev tools on the site

    Variable .... var ANYVARIABLENAME;

    Var is a keyword of javascript

    Var - means you arent allowed to use these worlds for anything... This can only be used in JS

    <!-- IE: -->
<!-- var AnyVariableName; -->
<!-- // Kebab or pascal or snake? usuable?  -->
<!-- // You use camelCase Java script -->
<!-- // python is Snakecase -->

myVariablenName = " Hello, World!!!";
<!-- Assigning a variable a value, or a string value with "" -->
<!-- matters what data types they are... No data and numbers at the same TimeRanges -->


<!-- Example. -->
var myVariableName;
myVariableName = "Hello, master"
console.log(" your master is not my master)

<!-- Reassign the value of a variable... Yes -->

var myVariableName = "freak"
console.log(myVariableName)        <--- This is just for the console.log >

var Pokeman = prompt();
js console log willl give you the error line that is having the issue

this will give you a return value

var freak = prompt();
console.log(pokemon);

Window.prompt()

} else {
