## Welcome to my page

# Bio
My Name is Anthony Williams, I am a 25 year old that learned really early in life that nothing is free, the world doesnt care about you any more than you care about it, you're not entitled to anything, and nothing is easy. My mother passed away from Metastatic Melanoma when I was 11 years old. I moved with my father, That I didnt know. My parents were divorced before my brain could even make a cognative memory. I grew up with my mom, my sister, my half sister that was a druggie, and a half brother that was a druggie / career criminal. I watched many bad examples of how to live your life and I decided rather than follow in those footsteps, to plow my own path in life and show how a "expected failure" can succeed. I moved with my father across the country with his new wife. They kicked my sister and I out to my uncles house. I was in highschool when I met my wife. My uncled ended up kicking me out and I had to live with my wife (girlfriend) at the time and her parents. I decided the Army was the place to be. I got on my feet and took the world by the reigns and rode the whip. Here i am 8 years later. I had a sucessfull career in the Army, Deployed and served my country, I am already the longest married male in my family, a father to two Punks boys (not really), 4 y/o and 9 m/o, Own my own home at 25, own 2 cars, 0 debt, and not a shame to my name. Take that Destiny. Take that and turn back around. I write my own story. 

## Quotes
"You are the auther of your own story." 

"A man came up to a Guru, and said "I want to be successful in life." the Guru said "Alright, meet me at the beach at 6am." The man thought "what the beach? I said I want to be sucessfull not learn how to swim?"... The man gets to the beach at 6am and Guru says "go out there to the end of the dock. If you want to be sucessfull you walk out there to the end of the dock." The man walked out there and as soon as he got there the Guru pushed him under the water and held him there just shy of him drowning and he brought him back up and he said "now when you were under water, what did you want to do the most?" He said **"BREATH"** and the Guru said "If you want to **SUCCEED**, as bad as you want to **BREATH**.... **THAN** you will be **SUCCESSFUL**" 

## My Opinions
Your mindset should be never ending. If you think you are the smartest person in the room, than you're in the wrong room. There will always be somebody smarter, faster and better than you at any given task. Heres the deal, stop wallowing in self pity, pick yourself from failing and do it again but harder. Keep grinding. Never quit.  Growing in whatever thing you are doing is a should be a non stop, constant grind. Incasing all information you know, you want to know, and you need to know. Take your dream and than drive your life for 5 steps past that. Notice when competition runners go 150% until after they have passed the finish line? 

1. In the Army the Flag on my right shoulder is backwards due to always moving forward. I have found it in my own personal life that, that meaning has really brought a different aspect into my life. I take that as I should never retreat. Nothing is to big or complicated to learn and deal with. The Army also tought me something that i dont think they realized they did. They tought me, to start the day off with a completed task; Making your bed. If you make your bed in the morning, that will start you off on the right foot for the day. You can go onto your day with already a completed task, feeling accomplished. 

2. You have to walk before you run. Just because you don't know something now, doesnt mean you cant learn it in the future. Rather than being jealous of somebody that knows more than you, inhale as much information and knowledge as humanly possible. Take notes. Ask questions. Be humble enough to realize there is always something to learn from other people.

3. Failure is the BEST way to learn something. If you think your going to ~~fail~~ you will. Keep a motivated mindset.
